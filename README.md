# No longer maintained

Riot now has an official [parcel plugin](https://github.com/riot/parcel-plugin-riot), so this one is no longer needed.

# parcel-plugin-riotjs

A plugin for compiling riot tags with parcel.

## Riot Configuration
Your riot configs could be on a riot(inside package.json), .riotrc(json) or .riotrc.js

## TODO

- [ ] Read "ext" option
- [ ] Check sourcemaps
